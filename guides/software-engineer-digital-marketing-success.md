# Software Engineers! The power of Digital Marketing

> TL;DR: This Github gist will help you start your software engineering career in digital marketing industry.

If you check [**my profile as a digital marketing engineer**](https://github.com/digital-marketing-engineer/digital-marketing-engineer), you might notice that my GitHub profile is relatively new. You may have already guessed that this isn't my main GitHub profile.

However, the truth is that I began my journey as a digital marketer back in 2009, during my first year of university. At that time, I was involved in side hustles like link sales while studying software engineering.

In short, I eventually became a full-fledged software engineer and didn't touch digital marketing for years. Now, with side hustles becoming more common, I've embarked on my journey as a digital marketing engineer for the past three years.

I've created several GitHub repositories to document my journey, including:

- [Software Engineer Affiliate Program Hub](https://github.com/digital-marketing-engineer/software-engineer-affiliate-program-hub)
- [Designer Affiliate Program Hub](https://github.com/digital-marketing-engineer/designer-affiliate-program-hub)
- [Digital Marketing Tools](https://github.com/digital-marketing-engineer/digital-marketing-tools)
- and more

You might think that I'm using the power of AI, such as ChatGPT, to create these repositories, and that this information is not valuable because we can easily ask ChatGPT. However, the truth is, there's a wealth of expert knowledge in the field of digital marketing that you need to grasp before creating these repositories:

- It starts with ideation, determining what's the best repository that's worth your time to read.
- It continues with researching the tools that are genuinely helpful for the repository's topic.
- Checking whether these tools are still active and offer practical benefits. For example, for affiliate programs, are they still accepting registrations?
- Regularly updating the repositories when I find new tools that can be beneficial for you.

Without further ado, let's check it.
